all commands must be published by the player or the ui
    if you publish from the model then it will get duplicated in a multi-player game

commands are not sent to subscribers that are paused
    so if a subscriber needs to unpause itself based off a command
    then it'll be waiting forever
    best option is to subscribe twice, with the former pausing and unpausing the latter

to avoid complicated situations where the player quits while the commands are halfway through processing
    only save on idle
