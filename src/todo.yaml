select tool
  break drag listeners out into own methods

  if path is selected
  when hitting delete
  then selected path should be deleted
  (instead of switching to the delete tool)
  
  listen out for foreground color changes
  and if items are selected
  then recolor them too

  so even if your current color is red, choosing red again with items selected will make them red
  simple, i kinda like it

    yes, that would be nice
  grid
    grid size
  delete all

two finger scrolling?
  no side scrolling or zooming?
    that would be simplest
    and we are going for simple
